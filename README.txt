Notes: Make sure to change all the folder locations before running code

Steps: 
1) Create a clone of folder to ensure a backup
2) Run "DeleteUnwantedFiles" code, will remove all files that are not .JPG
3) Run "FileSorter" to sort all files into folders
4) FileSorter will create another folder for duplicates, the first version will be sorted correctly and the second 
version will be placed into the duplicates folder, instead of both being placed in the duplicate folder
5) If needed, use the "NamingErrorFinder", this will find the original folder in the original unsorted version of all the data,
this is essentially finding the letter after the PN in the sorted data so you can copy the folder into an errors folder
6) Run the "ChangeFileDateCreation" to complete the data transfer
